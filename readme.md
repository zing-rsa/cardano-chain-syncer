## cardano chain syncer

This project is an [Ogmios](https://ogmios.dev/) client that walks the Cardano blockchain from a given point in time until it reaches the tip of the chain, at which point it will follow the tip. It is configured to cherry pick relevant information about certain addresses and assets.
